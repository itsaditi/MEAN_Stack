Demo of a simple application made using Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular 8+, Node JS. This is a part of a Linkedin Course named as "MEAN Stack and MongoDB: Development Techniques" by Alexzendar Zanfir. Even though Angular used in this course is of the old version, I was able to use my basic knowledge of the latest version of Angular.

This course was a great opportunity to get my hands dirty on backend technologies.
